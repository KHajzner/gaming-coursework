Credits:
- objects in the UI/HealthUI folder and all code fragments marked by `Health UI by ariel oliveira` and ending with `End of Health UI` are 
made by ariel oliveira [o.arielg@gmail.com] and taken from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/simple-heart-health-system-120676
and adapted slightly to fit my code

- Pathfinding2D, Node2D and Grid2D are made using @pixelfac
pixelfac's code from https://github.com/pixelfac/2D-Astar-Pathfinding-in-Unity/tree/master
